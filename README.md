# AgilentDevopsTask
## The goal of this technical exercise is to show candidates skills set as well as ability to adapt in predetermined build environment. The exercise is consisted of several tasks, as follows:
1.	Creation of two virtual machines:
a.	The first is used for git, Jenkins and SonarQube (Linux),
b.	And the second is designated as build machine (Windows 2012 should have 2 cores);
2.	Installation of Jenkins;
3.	Installation of SonarQube server;
4.	Configuration of Build machine:
a.	Installation of JDK 8,
b.	Connecting the machine to Jenkins as a Node,
c.	Setting up the necessary tools (sonar scanner);
5.	Install git on first VM, set up local repository and commit the project files to it,
6.	From first commit, branch master to new branch called develop;
7.	Creation of Maven projects structure;
8.	When Maven project structure is finished on develop branch, merge it to master;
9.	Creation of Maven Jenkins job;
10.	Comparison of times when between maven single and multithreaded.
There are some additional information regarding Maven projects structure. The Maven project three should look as shown below:

### With this paper there are additional files that include the samples of Java project and Maven project to be used as helpers.
